# Installation

---

After cloning the repo:\
`cd pheno-wheat`\
`pip install virtualenv` (if you don't already have virtualenv installed)\
`python3 -m virtualenv envwheat` to create the virtual environment for the project\
`source envwheat/bin/activate` to activate virtual environment\
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements

Install mmdetection and mmsegmentation by following:
1. mmdetection
````
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git
cd mmdetection
pip install -v -e .
# "-v" means verbose, or more output
# "-e" means installing a project in editable mode,
# thus any local modifications made to the code will take effect without reinstallation.
````
2. mmsegmentation
````
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation.git
cd mmsegmentation
pip install -v -e .
# "-v" means verbose, or more output
# "-e" means installing a project in editable mode,
# thus any local modifications made to the code will take effect without reinstallation.

### 1. Spike Segmentation

Download the [Spike segmentation dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O5Iauv3vrC3NFLrJDZwnUPTdb72uZxSY/view?usp=share_link) \
Extract the zip file in the **data** directory in the following structure:
```
pheno-wheat
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SPIKE_main
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ annotations
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ train
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ val
â””â”€â”€ ...
```
Run `./train_spike.sh` to train a model specified in the `train_spike.json` file under the key
*config*.\
(if permission denied error shows up use the command `chmod +x ./train_spike.sh`)\
Run `./test_spike.sh` to test the model specified in the `test_spike.json` file under the key 
*config* loaded from the checkpoint file 
specified under the key *checkpoint*
